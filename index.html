						<h1>Rich Dad And Poor Dad</h1>
						<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and
							the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts
							about money and investing. He says that his poor dad went to Stanford and earned a Ph.D.,
							and his rich dad never finished the eighth grade. The book consists of 8 chapters, lessons
							that everyone must learn. The central message conveyed by Kiyosaki is that you don’t need to
							earn a high income to be rich.</p>

											<h4>Chapter One</h4>
											<h6>The Rich Don&apos;t Work for Money</h6>
											<p>The author, Robert Kiyosaki, introduces the concept of financial education and the difference between having a "poor dad" and a "rich dad." He explains that his "poor dad," or his biological father, had a good education and a secure job, but struggled financially and never truly became financially successful. His "rich dad," or his best friend's father, was less educated but was able to achieve financial success through investing and building assets. The author argues that traditional education does not teach financial literacy and that it is important for individuals to educate themselves in order to achieve financial success.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Two</h4>
											<h6>Why Teach Financial Literacy?</h6>
											<p>In chapter 2, Robert Kiyosaki, talks about the difference between assets and liabilities. He explains that assets put money in your pocket while liabilities take money out of your pocket. He also describes how most people are taught to work for money, pay bills, and save what is left over, rather than acquiring assets that will generate income. He emphasizes that the rich focus on acquiring assets, while the poor and middle class focus on getting more education and a higher-paying job to pay for their liabilities. The author encourages readers to change their mindset and start thinking about acquiring assets to increase their income.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Three</h4>
											<h6>Mind Your Own Business</h6>
											<p>Robert Kiyosaki, talks about the importance of understanding cash flow. He explains that cash flow is the difference between the money coming in and the money going out. He also highlights the fact that cash flow is more important than the price of an asset and how most people focus on the price of assets rather than the cash flow it generates. He also introduces the concept of "cash flow quadrant" where he explains the different types of people in terms of how they earn money, either as employees, self-employed, business owners or investors. He encourages the reader to aim to become an investor, rather than just an employee or self-employed person, as investors earn money through assets, while the others earn money through their own efforts or labor.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Four</h4>
											<h6>The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations </h6>
											<p>The author talks about the importance of financial intelligence. He explains that financial intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one's money and assets. He also mentions that financial intelligence is different from education and that most people, even those with advanced degrees, lack financial intelligence. The author also shares that the traditional education system does not teach financial intelligence and that it is important for individuals to educate themselves in this area in order to achieve financial success. He also mentions that financial intelligence consists of several key skills such as accounting, investing, understanding markets, and the law. He encourages readers to develop their financial intelligence in order to achieve financial freedom.</p>

											<h4>Chapter Five</h4>
											<h6>The Rich Invent Money</h6>
											<p>In this chapter of "Rich Dad Poor Dad," Robert Kiyosaki, talks about the difference between being rich and being wealthy. He explains that being rich means having a high income, while being wealthy means having a positive cash flow and assets that generate income. He also talks about how people often confuse having a high income with being wealthy, and how this can lead to financial trouble if they are not able to manage their money and assets properly. He also mentions how most people focus on earning a high income, rather than building wealth through acquiring assets that generate income. The author encourages readers to focus on building wealth by acquiring assets and managing them for cash flow, rather than just focusing on earning a high income.</p>

											<h6>Work to Learn &hyphen; Don&apos;t Work for Money</h6> <!-- Extra Points -->
											<p>Chapter 6 talks about the importance of understanding the difference between assets and liabilities. He explains that assets are things that put money in your pocket, such as rental properties, while liabilities are things that take money out of your pocket, such as credit card debt. He also mentions how most people are taught to acquire liabilities, such as buying a big house or a new car, and how these things can lead to financial trouble if they are not able to manage them properly. He also encourages readers to focus on acquiring assets, such as rental properties or stocks, that can generate income and build wealth over time. He also mentions how the rich focus on acquiring assets and how the poor focus on acquiring liabilities.</p>

									<li>
										<p>The book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki describes the lessons he learned from two fathers in his life, one who was wealthy and one who was not, and how they influenced his views on money and investing. The author emphasizes that earning a high income is not necessary to be rich and that many people claim to not be interested in money, yet they work long hours at a job. The book also suggests that many people spend money on things they do not truly want and that setting clear financial goals can lead to a wealthy lifestyle. The book highlights that it is important to set one's mind to find and take advantage of opportunities for wealth.</p>
